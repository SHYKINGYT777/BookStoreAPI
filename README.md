THEORY / STUDY

1. Study of Repeater
A repeater is a network device used to regenerate and amplify signals so they can travel longer distances without getting weak. In large networks, when data travels through cables over long distances, the signal strength starts to drop. A repeater receives the weak signal and regenerates it to its original strength before sending it forward. This ensures that the data reaches its destination without loss or distortion. It operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model and is very useful in extending LANs or connecting distant buildings within a campus network.

2. Study of Hub
A hub is a simple and basic networking device that connects multiple computers or devices in a LAN (Local Area Network). When a hub receives data from one device, it broadcasts the data to all connected devices, regardless of the intended destination. This can cause unnecessary traffic and network congestion, especially in larger setups. Hubs work at the physical layer of the OSI model and do not filter data or check for the destination. Although they are mostly outdated now, they were once commonly used in small networks or for learning purposes.

3. Study of Switch
A switch is a more intelligent networking device compared to a hub. It connects multiple devices in a LAN and is capable of sending data only to the intended device, using MAC addresses. This reduces network traffic and improves performance. A switch works at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and can even work at Layer 3 (network layer) in more advanced models. Switches are widely used in modern networks because they are efficient, reliable, and secure.

4. Study of Router
A router is a device that connects two or more different networks and routes data from one network to another. It is commonly used to connect a local network (LAN) to the internet. Routers examine the IP address of data packets and determine the best path to send them. They work at the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model. In homes and offices, routers also often include built-in switches and wireless access points, making them multifunctional. Routers play a key role in data communication between different networks.

5. Study of NIC (Network Interface Card)
The Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware component that allows a computer or any device to connect to a network. It can be a separate card inserted into the motherboard or built into the system. There are wired NICs, which use Ethernet cables, and wireless NICs, which use Wi-Fi. Each NIC has a unique MAC address used for identification on a network. Without a NIC, a device cannot participate in any type of network communication. It operates as a bridge between the computer and the network medium.

6. Study of Wired Communication Channels
Wired communication uses physical cables to transfer data. One of the most common types is the CAT5 or CAT6 cable. These are twisted pair cables used for Ethernet networking. CAT5 supports up to 100 Mbps while CAT6 supports up to 1 Gbps or more, making it more suitable for high-speed networks. Another type is the coaxial cable, which has a single copper conductor in the center, surrounded by insulation, a metallic shield, and an outer cover. It was used in older Ethernet networks and is still used for cable TV. The fibre optic cable is the fastest and most advanced. It uses light instead of electricity to transmit data, providing very high speed and long-distance communication. It is made of glass or plastic fibers and is immune to electrical interference. Fibre optics are commonly used in backbone networks and for internet infrastructure. Connectors like RJ-45 (for Ethernet), BNC (for coaxial), and SC/LC (for fibre) are essential for connecting these cables properly.

7. Study of Wireless Communication Channels
Wireless communication allows data to travel without physical cables, using electromagnetic waves. The most common wireless medium is the radio wave, used in Wi-Fi, FM radio, and mobile networks. Radio waves can travel long distances and even pass through walls, making them ideal for indoor and outdoor use. Microwaves are used in satellite and cellular communication. They require a clear line of sight between transmitter and receiver and can cover large distances. Infrared waves are used for short-range communication, such as in TV remotes and some sensors. They cannot pass through walls and are suitable for close-range communication only. Each wireless medium has its own characteristics in terms of speed, range, and usage depending on the environment and application.

2.	Observed the physical ports and labels of each device and noted their functions.
3.	Studied different types of wired communication cables such as CAT5, CAT6, coaxial, and fibre optic.
4.	Identified the connectors used with each cable type and learned how they are attached.
5.	Observed wireless transmission using mobile hotspot or Wi-Fi router.

•	NIC allows a computer to connect to a network; each has a unique MAC address.
•	CAT6 cable supports higher speed than CAT5.
•	Coaxial is rarely used now except in TV connections.
•	Fibre optic is the fastest and most secure for long-distance communication.
•	Radio waves can travel through walls; infrared cannot.
•	Microwaves are used in telecom and need line-of-sight communication.

CONCLUSION
This practical helped me understand the real components involved in networking. I learned how different devices operate at different layers of the OSI model and how data is transferred using various media. The comparison between wired and wireless media showed how choice of communication channel affects speed, distance, and reliability. This study is very useful in understanding how modern computer networks function in homes, schools, offices, and industries.
